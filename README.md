## Development Guide

### Running the App on Web

1. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to the local address provided in the terminal (e.g., <http://localhost:5173>).

### Building and Running as an Android App

1. (One-time) Initialize Capacitor if you haven't already:

   ```sh
   npx cap init
   ```
   - App name: Scoreboard
   - App id: io.github.lelinhtinh.scoreboard
   - Web dir: dist

2. Build the web app for production:

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

3. Copy the build output to the native Android project:

   ```sh
   npx cap copy android
   ```

4. Open the Android project in Android Studio:

   ```sh
   npx cap open android
   ```

5. In Android Studio:
   - Wait for Gradle sync to complete.
   - Connect a device or start an emulator.
   - Click **Run** (the green triangle) to install and launch the app.
   - To generate APK/AAB for distribution: Go to **Build > Build APK(s)** or **Build Bundle(s)**.

#### Notes for Developers

- After making changes to the web code, always repeat steps 2 and 3 before running or building the Android app again.
- To update the app launcher icon, use Android Studio's **Image Asset** tool to replace icons in `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-*`.
- All Capacitor dependencies are already included in `package.json`.
- For advanced native features, refer to the [Capacitor documentation](https://capacitorjs.com/docs).
